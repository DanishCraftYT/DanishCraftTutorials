            <h2>Creating a Python script</h2>
            <p>
                to do so. go to your desktop and right-click. under the "New" section.
                select "Text Document". now give it a name and change it's extension to ".py".<br>

            <h2>Running a Python script</h2>
            <p>
                to run a python script. go to your Desktop folder in File Explorer.
                in the folder path at the top of File Explorer. type "cmd" and hit enter.<br>
                <img src="Images/open_cmd.png"><br>
                this will open cmd in the folder that was opened in File Explorer.
                now type "python 'script_name'" and hit enter. this will run the python script.<br>
                <img src="Images/cmd_exe_py.png"><br>
                you will probably notice that nothing happened and that's because we haven't written
                any code in our Python script yet.
